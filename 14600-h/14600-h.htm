<h3>PREFACE</h3>

  <p>The silk industry of America has of late years rapidly advanced to the
  front rank among the great textile industries of the world. It may indeed
  be proud of this position, to which that enterprising spirit and untiring
  energy peculiar to our nation, combined with our great technical and
  natural resources, has brought it.</p>

  <p>That we are, on the other hand, not yet at the height of perfection we
  are also compelled to acknowledge, but if we consider the short space of
  time that the American industry has required for its development, as
  compared to the decades, almost centuries, to which some of the great
  European silk centers can look back, the fact is neither surprising nor
  discouraging.</p>

  <p>While it must not be our aim to imitate or copy their ways, inasmuch
  as out conditions and circumstances are quite different from theirs, we
  may still profitably study their methods in order to overcome our
  deficiencies.</p>

  <p>The greatest advantage which our competitors derive from such a long
  existence consists in having at their disposal a force of skilful,
  trained help. The manufacturers, appreciating the importance of this
  factor, make great efforts and pecuniary sacrifices to elevate and
  maintain the high standard of their industry.</p>

  <p>For instance, they support textile schools and lecture courses, where
  young men can acquire a thorough technical education and equip themselves
  for a career of usefulness, thereby serving their own interests and at
  the same time furthering those of their chosen profession.</p>

<!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6"></a>[pg 6]</span>

  <p>This beneficial influence cannot fail to exert itself from the
  standard of the higher employer down to that of the weaver, who would
  naturally take more pains and interest in his work than if he were a mere
  mechanical appendage to his loom in order to keep it in motion.</p>

  <p>Very little has been done in his country for technical education as
  far as the silk industry is concerned, and it was on this special branch,
  that prompted the author to offer in the present little work a treatise
  on the theory of shaft weaving for broad silks and ribbons.</p>

  <p>It is divided into three principal parts:</p>

      <p class="i8"><b>1st. Drawing-in the warp in the harness.</b></p>
      <p class="i8"><b>2nd. The weaves and their application.</b></p>
      <p class="i8"><b>3rd. Decomposition or analysis of the cloth.</b></p>

  <p>To the foregoing there have been added in the revised and enlarged
  edition several additional parts covering the following: JACQUARD WEAVES,
  BOX LOOM WEAVES, including CREPES, and COST CALCULATIONS for plain and
  fancy weaves.</p>

  <p>The subject while condensed, is made as clear and comprehensible as
  possible, and to many desirous of increasing their knowledge in this
  direction, this should prove a valuable help.</p>

  <p>The author, through the medium of this work, hopes to win the approval
  and encouragement of the manufacturers, and will feel amply repaid should
  his efforts tend to develop a deeper interest in the "Queen of
  Textiles."</p>

<h2>THEORY OF SILK WEAVING</h2>

<h3>DRAWING-IN</h3>

  <p>With this term we designate the operation preceding the weaving, by
  which all the warp-threads are drawn through the heddles of the
  harness.</p>

  <p>The order in which this is done varies according to the weave and the
  nature of the fabric to be produced; so we distinguish:</p>

      <p class="i8"><b>Straight draws,</b></p>
      <p class="i8"><b>Skip draws,</b></p>
      <p class="i8"><b>Point draws,</b></p>
      <p class="i8"><b>Section draws.</b></p>

<hr />

<h3>STRAIGHT DRAWS</h3>

<a name="Fig_1"></a>
<div class="figcenter">

  </div>
<hr class="short"/>

<!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8"></a>[pg 8]</span>

<a name="Fig_2"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig2.png"
alt="Fig. 2" /><br />Fig. 2
  </div>
  <p>These form the simplest and most common method of drawing-in. We begin
  with the first heddle on the left side of the shaft <i>nearest to the
  warp-beam</i>, then take the first heddle of second shaft and so on until
  all the shafts the set contains are used in rotation. This completes one
  "draw," and this operation is repeated until all the warp-threads are
  taken up.</p>

  <p>The method of making the shaft nearest to the warp-beam the first, is
  almost universal with the silk business and is technically called
  <i>drawing-in from back to front</i>.</p>

  <p>The opposite, or drawing in from <i>front to rear</i>, is used
  occasionally, however, and in this case makes the first heddle on the
  left hand side of the front shaft No. 1.</p>

  <p>The making out of the <i>Drawing-in Draft</i>, which must indicate the
  arrangement or the rotation in which the warp-threads are drawn in, can
  be done in various ways, of which we will mention the two most popular
  methods. The first is by using common designing paper, and indicating the
  rotation by dots. The horizonal rows of squares represent the shafts, the
  vertical rows the warp-threads. Fig. <a href="#Fig_1">1</a> shows four
  repeats of a straight draw on six harness marked out according to this
  idea. A second method is to use paper ruled horizontally, the lines
  representing the shafts; and to draw vertical lines
<!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9"></a>[pg 9]</span>
  for the warp-threads.
  The latter are made to stop on the lines bearing the number of the shafts
  into which the respective threads are to be drawn. Fig. <a
  href="#Fig_2">2</a> is such a draft, illustrating six repeats of a draw
  on four harness from "Front to Rear."</p>

<hr />

<h3>SKIP DRAWS</h3>

  <p>The draws coming under this heading are used very extensively in silk
  weaving, especially for fabrics requiring a heavy warp and a large number
  of shafts. Enter first the odd and then the even shafts. An 8 harness
  draw of this kind, of which three repeats are shown in Fig. <a
  href="#Fig_3">3</a>, runs as follows: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8.</p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#Fig_4">4</a> is a 12 harness draw of the same
  class.</p>

<!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11"></a>[pg 11]</span>

  <p>Point draws are a combination of a regular straight draw from back to
  front and one from front to back, the first and the last shafts only
  being used once, while the rest receive two ends each in one repeat of
  the draw. Fig. <a href="#Fig_5">5</a> illustrates a regular point draw in
  2 repeats on 10 shafts. It will be seen that 14 ends make a repeat; in
  fact, the number of warp-threads required for one draw will always be
  double the number of harness less 2, hence a 12 harness regular point
  draw will require 22 warp-threads for a repeat.</p>

  <p>The drawing-in draft illustrated in Fig. <a href="#Fig_6">6</a> is a
  slight variation of the regular point draw; it consists, as will be seen,
  of a draw from back to front, and also a full one from front to back,
  there by causing a <i>double point</i>.</p>

  <p>Another change from the regular point draw is illustrated in Figs. <a
  href="#Fig_7">7</a> and <a href="#Fig_8">8</a>; this class may be called
  <i>Broken point draws</i>, because a new draw is begun before the other
  one is complete. Fig. <a href="#Fig_9">9</a> also comes in this class and
  represents a <i>zigzag draw</i> on 10 harness.</p>

  <p>The drawing-in drafts which we have described under the head of "Point
  draws," are used mostly to obtain the various pointed and zigzag
  effects.</p>

  <p>This division of drawing-in drafts is used extensively in silk
  manufacturing; for instance, in all fabrics having a ground warp and a
  binder warp, also in double-face goods, or where two different weaves are
  combined in one effect.</p>

  <p>One or more threads are drawn on the first section, then one or more
  on a second and third, if the harness is divided in so many sets.</p>

  <p>The following examples will illustrate the principle of these
  draws.</p>

  <p>In Fig. <a href="#Fig_10">10</a>, shafts 1, 2, 3, 4 from the first
  set, shafts 5 and 6 the second, 8 threads are drawn straight on the
  first, then 2 on the second section.</p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#Fig_11">11</a>, first set shafts 1 to 6 inclusive,
  second set shafts 7 and 8.</p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#Fig_12">12</a> is drawn end and end on two sections
  having 8 shafts each.</p>

  <p>Figs. <a href="#Fig_13">13</a>, <a href="#Fig_14">14</a> and <a
  href="#Fig_15">15</a>, while not strictly belonging to the class of
  section draws, may, however, be considered under this heading. The idea
  is to draw a certain number of ends in one part of the harness and
  another group in another part, be it straight, point or skip, which will
  cause the effect on the cloth to be accordingly transposed or broken
  up.</p>

<h3>THE WEAVES
AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION</h3>

  <p>In any woven fabric we distinguish two systems of threads, the <i>Warp
  or Chain</i>, running lengthways in the cloth, and the <i>Filling or
  Weft</i>, crossing the former at right angles.</p>

  <p>This crossing or interlacing consists of every individual warp-thread
  being placed alternately under and over one or more threads of the
  filling system. The arrangement of this interlacing is technically called
  the <i>Weave</i>, and the variety in which the points of crossing can be
  distributed is practically endless.</p>

  <p>It is principally the weave that lends to a fabric its character,
  influenced, of course, by the material used, the size and tension of the
  threads and the combination of the colors.</p>

  <p>The weaves are divided into three main classes: <i>the Foundation
  weaves</i>. In the silk business they are known under the following
  names:</p>

      <p class="i8"><b>The Taffeta Weave,</b></p>
      <p class="i8"><b>The Serge Weave,</b></p>
      <p class="i8"><b>The Satin Weave.</b></p>

  <p>In the foundation weaves each thread effects only one crossing in one
  repeat of the weave, and the points of interlacing occur in a given
  rotation. A repeat in the foundation weaves comprises the same number of
  warp-threads as of
<!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16"></a>[pg 16]</span>
  <i>picks</i> or filling threads, and if
  this number is 8, for instance, the weave is called an 8-shaft or an
  8-harness weave. In marking out a weave, the warp-threads are represented
  by vertical lines, the filling by horizontal ones, or in each case by the
  space between these lines. The places where a warp-thread lies over the
  filling are marked with paint or simply with a cross. In a similar manner
  we mark out the <i>chain draft</i>, which indicates the rotation in which
  the shafts are raised.</p>

<hr />

<!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17"></a>[pg 17]</span>

<h3>THE TAFFETA WEAVE</h3>

  </div>

<!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18"></a>[pg 18]</span>

  <p>This is the simplest and oldest method of interlacing. The odd numbers
  of warp-threads cross the even numbers after every pick; hence of two
  warp-threads one will always go over the first pick and under the second,
  and the other end under the first and over the second pick. Taffeta
  cloth, therefore, has the same appearance on both sides, and in cotton
  and wool weaving this weave is technically&mdash;and properly
  indeed&mdash;called the <i>Plain Weave</i>. It has the smallest repeat, 2
  warp-threads and 2 picks, and the exchanging of warp and filling is the
  most frequent possible. The cloth thus produced is firmer and stronger
  than that obtained with any other weave.</p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#Fig_16">16</a> is a taffeta on 4 shafts straight draw,
  the draft executed in the manner which we have already mentioned in
  explaining the drawing-in drafts.</p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#Fig_17">17</a> on common designing paper, illustrates a
  taffeta made on 8-harness, skip draw.</p>

  <p>Be it mentioned that the drawing-in draft and the chain draft will be
  added throughout this work, the former over the weave to correspond with
  the respective warp-threads, the latter to the right of the drawing-in
  draft.</p>

  <p>In this weave the working of the warp is the same as in taffeta,
  except that instead of one pick, two or more are inserted in the same
  shed. It is mostly used in selvedges, where it serves to give more
  firmness to the edge of an otherwise loosely woven cloth, and prevents
  the weaving ahead of the edge in a tight weave. Gros de Tours is
  sometimes used, especially when cotton or wool filling is employed, with
  a view to lay two picks nicely side by side, whereas a thread entered two
  ply with the taffeta weave will always receive some twist, which may
  disturb the perfect evenness of the fabric.</p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#Fig_18">18</a> is a Gros de Tours with two picks on
  four harness straight through.</p>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#Fig_19">19</a> illustrates this weave with three picks
  drawn end and end on two sections of four shafts each.</p>

<hr />

<!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20"></a>[pg 20]</span>

<h3>SERGE or TWILL WEAVES</h3>

  <p>While the taffeta weave produces either an entirely smooth fabric, or
  one with a distinct transverse rib as in gros-grain, the twill weave
  forms diagonal lines on the cloth, running either from left to right or
  from right to left.</p>

  <p>To make a twill, not less than three ends and three picks are
  required, of which each thread floats over two of the other system and
  interlaces with the third. The rotation of the interlacing is always
  consecutive, that is it moves with each succeeding pick one thread to the
  right (or to the left if the lines are to run in that direction). If warp
  and filling have the same texture, that is the same number of threads in
  a given space, the twill lines will form an angle of 45°; if the warp
  stands closer than the filling, the incline will be steeper, and in the
  opposite case the angle will approach more the horizontal.</p>

  <p>The weaves can be expressed in numbers, for instance: the 3-end twill
  warp effect would be marked 2-1, which indicates that each warp-thread
  goes over two and under one pick.</p>

  <p>Twill weaves are called <i>evensided</i> when the arrangement of "warp
  up" and "filling up" are evenly balanced, and <i>unevensided</i> if
  either warp or filling predominate on the face of the fabric; the latter
  class is therefore subdivided in <i>Warp effects</i> and <i>Filling
  effects</i>.</p>

  <p>In the following a number of serge weaves are illustrated, the French
  designations being added in some cases, as they are still extensively
  used in the trade.</p>

<h3>SATIN WEAVES</h3>

  <p>The distinct diagonal lines which characterize the class of weaves
  explained in the previous chapter are absent in the satin weaves; and
  while the interlacing in the former is done in a strictly consecutive
  order, we endeavor to scatter the points of stitching in the latter as
  much as possible, in order
<!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33"></a>[pg 33]</span>
  to create an entirely smooth and
  brilliant surface on the cloth.</p>

  <p>In all satins the number of ends in a repeat is the same in warp and
  filling.</p>

  <p>The lowest repeat of a regular satin comprises five threads of each
  system, and the interlacing is done in the following order:</p>

  <div class="c">
  <table>
  <tr><td>The</td><td>1st</td><td>pick</td><td>with the</td><td>1st</td><td>warp-thread</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="c">"</td><td>2d</td><td class="c">"</td><td class="c">"</td><td>3d</td><td class="c">"</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="c">"</td><td>3d</td><td class="c">"</td><td class="c">"</td><td>5th</td><td class="c">"</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="c">"</td><td>4th</td><td class="c">"</td><td class="c">"</td><td>2d</td><td class="c">"</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="c">"</td><td>5th</td><td class="c">"</td><td class="c">"</td><td>4th</td><td class="c">"</td></tr>
  </table>
  </div>

  <p>Fig. <a href="#Fig_43">43</a> illustrates this weave. An examination
  of the rotation, as given above, will show that every warp-thread
  intersects two picks apart from its neighbor. The number "2" is in this
  case what is technically known as the <i>counter</i>, that is the number
  which indicates the points of interlacing by adding it to number 1 and
  continuing so until all the warp-threads are taken up.</p>

  <p>The following is the rule to find the counter for any regular
  satin:</p>

  <p>Divide the number of harness into two parts, which must neither be
  equal nor have a common divisor. Any of these two numbers can be used for
  counting off, but usually the smaller one is taken. According to this
  rule we obtain a regular satin</p>

  <tr><td class="c">"</td><td class="r">7</td><td class="c">"</td><td class="c">"</td><td>2 or 3</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="c">"</td><td class="r">8</td><td class="c">"</td><td class="c">"</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="c">"</td><td class="r">9</td><td class="c">"</td><td class="c">"</td><td>2 or 4</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="c">"</td><td>10</td><td class="c">"</td><td class="c">"</td><td>3</td></tr>

  <tr><td class="c">"</td><td>12</td><td class="c">"</td><td class="c">"</td><td>5</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="c">"</td><td>13</td><td class="c">"</td><td class="c">"</td><td>2, 3, 4, 5 or 6</td></tr>

  <p>The 4 harness broken twill, Fig. <a href="#Fig_53">53</a>, is

  <p>The 6 harness satin, Fig. <a href="#Fig_54">54</a>, is irregular; as a

<h3>DERIVATIVE WEAVES</h3>

<h4><b>1. From the Taffeta</b></h4>

  <p><i>Royale</i> is a modification of the regular Gros de Tours, inasmuch
  as the rib line, which in the latter runs straight across the cloth, is
  broken off after a given number of warp-threads. These groups, which may
  comprise 8, 12 or more threads, will interlace each one pick higher than
  the preceding one.</p>

<p class="c"><i>Royale of 8 ends</i></p>

alt="Fig. 55" /><br />Fig. 55
  </div>
<hr class="short"/>

<p class="c"><i>Velours Ottoman or Faille française.</i></p>

  <p>In order to obtain a broader rib than that of Gros de Tours, and at
  the same time to lend firmness to the fabric, we add to the ground warp,
  which forms the ribs, another
<!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
  or binder warp, which works continually
  taffeta, while the ground warp changes only every 3 or 4 picks for the
  rib.</p>

<p class="c"><i>Faille française.</i></p>

  <div class="c">
  <table>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>ends of</td><td>ground</td><td>on the</td><td>first</td><td>section of </td><td>8</td><td>shafts,</td><td>skip draw.</td></tr>

<p class="c"><i>Velours Ottoman without a Binder-warp.</i></p>

  <p>In this weave, of which Fig. <a href="#Fig_57">57</a> illustrates a
  specimen, comprising 8 warp-threads and 32 picks in a repeat, the rib
  contains 4 picks. Of the 8 warp-threads, 3 float over and 3 under the
  rib, while the 2 others bind taffeta, which latter function is executed
  by 2 other threads in the next rib.</p>

  </div>
<hr />

<h4>2. From the Twills</h4>

  <p>One variety is obtained by interlacing the warp-threads alternately
  one or more picks behind, and then a number of picks ahead of their
  respective neighbors; so the complete arrangement of the points of
  binding in a repeat will generally form two parallel diagonal lines. This
  will cause the twill lines to appear less pronounced than is the case in
  the regular twill, and the character of the fabric approaches more that
  of the satin.</p>

<h3>CANNELE and REPP WEAVES</h3>

  <p>are in their construction related to the taffeta, and are used mostly
  in the form of stripes as an additional ornament to a fabric. The threads
  going into the composition of these effects exchange continually from
  taffeta interlacing to floating over a certain number of threads, and
  must be introduced either in warp or filling close enough to make the
  floats cover up the taffeta work entirely, and thus enable the material
  used to show up with the full brilliancy it possesses.</p>

  <p>Cannele effects can be produced in two distinct ways. One is to let
  every individual thread work alternately taffeta and float, while in the
  other method one thread weaves always taffeta, and a second thread is
  used for the cannele exclusively. These latter threads must come from a
  separate warp, which is introduced to embellish the ground or taffeta
  part of the fabric.</p>

  <p>The floating threads can either stitch all on one pick and so form a
  continuous cut line, or be divided in groups, of which one will bind in
  the middle of the floats of the other group. The following designs show
  both the face and backside of the respective weaves:</p>

<h3>DOUBLE FACED FABRICS</h3>

  <p>In this class we find either two systems of warp or of filling so
  combined that only one will be visible on either side. The color on one
  side is generally different from the other, and so may the interlacing be
  of a different nature on face and back. In the latter case great care
  must be exercised not to allow the weave on one side to disturb the one
  on the other, and as a rule the points of interlacing of the first warp
  or filling system are placed as much as possible in the middle of the
  floats of the second. This will prevent either color or weave to be seen
  on the opposite side, as the floats of one side will naturally lay
  themselves over the binders of the other. The number of ends in a repeat
  of the two weaves must either be alike or one a multiple of the
  other.</p>

<h3>PEKINS</h3>

  <p>With this name we designate fabrics in which stripes of a different
  interlacing run in the direction of the warp. In combining these weaves
  it is advantageous to have them contrast distinctly, for instance, a
  short weave such as taffeta or Gros de Tours, with a longer and looser
  one such as satin, sergé or cannele, also changes from warp to filling
  effects. Care must be taken to arrange the joining of the two weaves so
  that the last thread of one weave will cross the first thread of the
  other. This will prevent the threads from either stripe to slide over
  into the other, and so make a clean cut line.</p>

<h3>BAYADÈRES</h3>

  <p>While pekins are formed by warp stripes, bayadère shows us stripes of
  different weaves running in the direction of the filling. The rules given
  in the previous chapter as to the joining of the weaves will also apply
  here. The warp which was raised on the last pick of the weave must stay
  down wherever possible on the first pick of the following weave. The
  number of shafts employed must go up evenly in the repeat of each one of
  the weaves that go into the make up of the bayadère.</p>

<!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68"></a>[pg 68]</span>

<h3>1. THE WEAVE</h3>

  <p>If a given sample is to be reproduced or imitated, it must be
  analyzed, and the following hints will greatly facilitate this operation
  to the beginner.</p>

  <p>Cut the sample straight on two sides, and draw out a number of warp
  and filling threads until there is a small fringe of perhaps ¼ of an
  inch. This will allow a thread to be raised a little for examination,
  without danger of its falling out of the fabric. In most cases it is
  easier to dissect the filling side, that is, the interlacing of each
  warp-thread in the threads of the filling system. With the help of the
  microscope or counting glass we can easily determine over and under how
  many picks that thread passes and the points of interlacing are
  accordingly marked on designing paper. This being done for at least the
  length of a repeat warpways, we take it out and examine the following
  thread, and so on until the repeat filling-ways is complete. It is
  advisable to ascertain how many picks ahead or back of the first examined
  thread the next following one binds before taking the former out.</p>

  <p>A knowledge of the construction of weaves as explained in the
  foregoing chapters will enable us to determine the weave of a simple
  pattern by merely raising a warp-thread with a needle on any point of
  interlacing and counting off how many picks apart from this place it
  makes an impression.</p>

<h3>2. LENGTH AND WIDTH OF THE FABRIC</h3>

  <p>To the length and width which the finished product is to have, we must
  add a certain allowance for shrinkage and <i>taking up</i> of warp during
  weaving. It may differ from one to ten per cent., according to the
  texture and weave of the fabric, and can be ascertained with sufficient
  accuracy by stretching out and measuring a thread of warp and filling and
  comparing their length with the respective measurements of the sample to
  be reproduced.</p>

<!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69"></a>[pg 69]</span>

<h3>3. THE STOCK AND ITS DYE</h3>

  <p>Under this heading we must give the particulars as to nature,
  <i>twist</i>, <i>quality</i> and <i>size</i> of the silk, and the
  directions for the dyeing, whether <i>bright</i> or <i>souple</i>, and in
  what colors, also whether to be weighted or not.</p>

  <p>The size is generally ascertained (in practical work) by comparing it
  with other silk of which the exact count is known. Another method is to
  count the number of cocoon threads which a thread of the sample contains,
  adding to that 1/3 or ¼, according to the quality of the silk; the result
  will be the count in deniers. To obtain it in drams, divide the latter
  number by 17,3 as 1 dram is equal to 17,3 deniers.</p>

  <p>Suppose we find 20 cocoon ends in a thread of silk: add 1/3, and we
  have 26-2/3 deniers, which, divided by 17,3 make 1,54 drams.</p>

  <p>As silk is always more or less uneven, it is safer to count the cocoon
  fibers of several threads and to take average thereof.</p>

  <p>It requires the experience of years to judge with any degree of
  certainty as to the origin and quality of silk, whether it be
  "classical," "extra," "sublime," etc.</p>

  <p>There are machines wherewith to ascertain exactly the twist, that is,
  the number of turns the silk has received in the throwing process.</p>

  <p>In the dyeing we distinguish two great classes, of which the names
  themselves give a good definition. "Bright" has a brilliant luster, while
  "souple" has more of a dull, subdued appearance. To find out whether the
  silk has been weighted in the dyeing process, we may compare it with
  other silk of which the exact conditions are known, or we may burn a
  small quantity of it. Unweighted silk does not burn readily and leaves a
  residue of white ashes, while heavy weighted silk burns lively, leaving
  black, charry ashes.</p>

<!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70"></a>[pg 70]</span>

<h3>4. REED CALCULATION</h3>

  <p>We count the number of repeats of the weave in a given space,
  generally ¼ or ½ inch, and multiply this with the number of threads one
  repeat contains, which gives us the reduction of the warp.</p>

  <p>Suppose we had a taffeta, which, as we know, has only 2 ends to a
  repeat, and counted 30 interlacings per ¼ inch on one pick; we would have
  60 threads per ¼ inch or 240 per one inch. In this case the reed may be
  80 by 3 or 60 by 4.</p>

  <p>Another instance: In an 8-shaft satin we count 10 warp-threads, which
  bind on the same pick in ¼ inch; this, multiplied by 8, equals 80 ends
  per ¼, or 320 per one inch; the reed will be an 80 with 4 in a dent or a
  64 by 5.</p>

  <p>In short, the number of the reed is found by dividing the number of
  warp-threads that are to go in one dent, in the number of ends per inch.
  Sometimes, the reed marks are clearly visible in a sample by holding the
  latter against the light. Silk fabrics move with very few exceptions
  within the limits of 50 and 90 dents per inch.</p>

  <p>To learn the full number of dents required for the width of the cloth,
  simply multiply the dents per one inch with the width, adding a certain
  allowance for shrinkage. The edges, of course, must also be taken in
  consideration, and very often the dents that are taken up by the latter
  are used to counter-balance that shrinkage.</p>

<h3>5. DRAWING-IN THE WARP IN HARNESS AND REED</h3>

  <p>Here we must specify the number of dents that contain the same number
  of ends, and whether the latter are single or double, also the number of
  shafts and the method of drawing-in.</p>

<!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71"></a>[pg 71]</span>

<h3>6. WARPING TICKET</h3>

  <p>To make out the warping ticket, we need to ascertain the total number
  of ends, whether leased single or double, and the arrangement of the
  colors.</p>

<h3>7. HARNESS ARRANGEMENT</h3>

  <p>This is governed by the number of ends to be drawn in and the
  necessary shafts. If we have, for instance, 100 threads per inch to be
  drawn on 4 shafts, we must give each shaft 25 heddles per inch. There are
  generally between 25 and 45 heddles per inch on one shaft.</p>

<h3>8. REDUCTION OF THE FILLING</h3>

  <p>Here we state the number of picks per inch, give directions as to
  doubling, if such is necessary, and if more than one color or shuttle is
  used, the rotation thereof.</p>

<h3>9. CALCULATION OF WARP AND FILLING</h3>

  <p>The system adopted in this country for specifying the size of silk is
  based on the weight in drams (avoirdupois) of a skein containing 1000
  yards. A skein, thus weighing 5 drams, is technically called 5-dram silk.
  The number of yards of 1-dram silk to a pound must accordingly be 256000.
  The formulas for figuring the amount of silk required for a piece of
  cloth are as follows:</p>

<h4>Warp Calculation</h4>

  <div class="blkquot">
  <table>
  <tr><td><i>Multiply:</i></td><td><u>Number of ends × length × count</u></td><td rowspan="2" class="vc">&nbsp;&nbsp;= lbs</td></tr>
  <tr><td><i>Divide by:</i></td><td class="c">1000 yards × 256 drams</td></tr>
  </table>
  </div>

<h4>Filling Calculation</h4>

  <tr><td><i>Divide by:</i></td><td class="c">1000 yards × 256 drams</td></tr>
  </table>
  </div>

  <div class="blkquot">
  <p>The result in both cases will be in pounds.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The system of grading the silk which is in vogue in Europe, and which
  is employed by a number of mills on this side, is as follows:</p>

<h3>10. FINISHING</h3>

  <p>Give directions as to the process of finishing to which the goods are
  to be subjected, whether to be pressed, calendered, sized, moiréd,
  etc.</p>

<h3>11. CALCULATION OF COST</h3>

  <p>If all the foregoing conditions are ascertained, and a sample or a
  piece of the fabric executed, it remains to the manufacturer to determine
  the exact figure at which he can produce the article. That this must be
  done with great accuracy is naturally of the utmost importance, and the
  calculator
<!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73"></a>[pg 73]</span>
  must know in the first place the raw
  stock prices, and also be acquainted with the details of the
  manufacturing process and the rates of wages paid therein. As a rule, the
  manufacturer establishes a scale of prices covering all the items of
  labor cost, mill expenses, etc., and uses this as a basis for his
  calculations.</p>

  <p>A rule or formula for this operation cannot very well be given, as the
  methods vary in almost every establishment, each choosing the one best
  adapted to its ideas or dictates of circumstances and conditions.</p>

<h3>JACQUARD WEAVES</h3>

  <p>Jacquard weaves usually show on a plain ground figure or flower
  effects. To obtain these effects the ground is made of one weave, say
  taffeta, while the figures or flowers are produced in another weave, say
  satin.</p>

  <p>We enter the warp through a jacquard harness, and according to the
  repeat use a 200, 400, 600, 900, 1200, etc., hook jacquard machine, which
  means 200, 400, 600, 900 and 1200 ends per repeat.</p>

  <p>With a 600-hook machine a larger repeat can be produced than with a
  499-hook machine. For instance, if we want to make a cloth the figures of
  which are to be two inches apart, it is a two-inch repeat, and use the
  count of 50/4 or 200 ends per inch, we can use a 400-hook machine, 2 in.
  x 200 ends. But we can make this cloth also on a 1200-hook machine, only
  the repeat must be designed three times. The advantage of using a
  1200-hook machine with the count 50/4 is that 2, 3, 4, 6-inch repeats can
  be produced, while with a 400-hook machine, only a 2-inch repeat can be
  made.</p>

  <p>There is no end to all the different weaves and the possible flower
  and other pattern effects that can be made with the jacquard machine. For
  a jacquard weaving plant the designing is the most important factor.</p>

<hr />

<h3>BOX LOOM WEAVES INCLUDING CREPES</h3>

  <p>Box looms are required for weaves such as bayadères, checks, plaids
  (see pages 63-65), bengalines, crêpes, etc., where two or more shuttles
  are needed to bring out the effect.</p>

  <p>For the crêpes (crêpe de chine, crêpe georgette) only two shuttles are
  needed, while plaids and other articles are made with more shuttles.</p>

  <p>To weave such articles the loom or the lay must be fitted with two or
  more shuttle boxes on one or both sides of the loom.</p>

<!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101"></a>[pg 101]</span>

  <p>If a manufacturer decides to change plain looms to box looms or buy
  new box looms, it is wise to get 4 × 4 boxes, or four shuttle boxes on
  each side.</p>

  <p>With these looms about everything can be made that is called for in
  box-loom effects, and as styles change, it is wise to be prepared.</p>

<hr />

<h3>MANUFACTURING COSTS</h3>

  <p>The calculator first ascertains for the warp: What silk will be used,
  the cost of the same, total number of ends in the warps for the amount of
  silk, cost of throwing, dyeing, winding, warping, twisting, entering, and
  weaving.</p>

  <p>Then the filling: Silk to be used, how much, cost of silk, cost of
  throwing, dyeing, winding, doubling, quilling.</p>

  <p>After this determine the cost of weaving, cloth picking, finishing,
  factory costs, and selling expenses.</p>

  <p>To-day most of the operations are paid by "piece work."</p>

  <p>The calculator must always take into consideration that poor raw silk
  or poor dyeing make production slow, increase the cost of labor, and also
  that more waste will be made.</p>

  <p>THROWING: Regular organ usually has 16 turns per inch in the first
  twist and 14 turns to the inch in the second or reverse twist. Tram
  receives only one twisting, about three turns to the inch.</p>

  <p>As the warp twisting-in is paid for at so much per hundred or thousand
  ends, no matter how short or long the warp is, it is a saving to make the
  warps as long as possible, especially in raw, black and staple
  colors.</p>

  <p>The calculator must not forget the cost of entering the first warp in
  a harness, also the reeding.</p>

  <p>Most mills figure the cost of harness and reed in the expense
  accounts. If plain and fancy goods are made an extra percentage should be
  figured for the latter.</p>

<!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102"></a>[pg 102]</span>

  <p>EXPENSES are figured differently, as almost every manufacturer has his
  own system. If a mill makes only a few staple articles it is easy to put
  down the cost of expenses. Say the mill has a production of 500,000 yards
  per year, that the expense amounts to $35,000, the cost then is 7 cents
  per yard.</p>

  <p>Manufacturers making all kinds of goods sometimes figure the expenses
  in percentage, say, for plain goods, with a few picks, like gros-grain,
  peau de soie, etc., 10 per cent. per yard. Taffeta, satin, etc., having
  more picks, 12½ per cent. per yard, and fancy and jacquard goods, 15 per
  cent. per yard. In the expense account we include all charges except raw
  silk, throwing, dyeing and piece work.</p>

  <p>SELLING EXPENSES. Before a calculation is finished we must add the
  selling expenses to the cost, also take account of the trade discount.
  Small mills usually sell through a commission house, which pays all
  expenses and charges a certain commission. Many large firms have their
  own selling end, and some have their sales guaranteed by a commission
  house or a bank.</p>

<h3>CALCULATIONS</h3>

  <p>The prices marked in the following calculations are about as in
  "normal times." Absolutely correct piece work prices cannot be given as
  different localities have different prices.</p>

  <p>Calculations are usually made per 100 yards, 100-meter warps.</p>

  <p>Most goods gain from 3 to 7 per cent. in weaving. That is, if we make
  a warp of 300 meters for a satin and we obtain 315 yards of cloth, this
  gain should not be calculated, as usually there is no account taken of
  samples used in the selling department. But the loss in length should be
  figured and taken account of on goods with a heavy rib, such as moiré,
  faille, etc.</p>

  <p>DISP. 7&mdash;A 3 1/3-inch repeat can be obtained with a 600-hook
  jacquard machine, seven repeats in a width of 23 inches.</p>

  <p>DISP. 8&mdash;Taffeta weave, but the two cotton picks must go in one
  hole. This article can only be made with at least two shuttle boxes on
  each side. For warping use a single and double cross reed, heavy cotton,
  no knots must be tied.</p>

  <p>DISP. 10&mdash;This article must be warped with as much tension as
  possible and no knots should be tied in. Silk is to be delivered on
  bobbins from throwster.</p>

<h4>CANTON CREPE</h4>

  <p>DISP. 9&mdash;Can also be made with Canton silk for filling and may be
  called Canton crêpe. As Canton silk is much cheaper than Japan, the
  manufacturer can use 4-thread Canton instead of 3-thread Japan for
  filling at a little difference in cost, thus the cloth will be heavier,
  but Canton silk is not as even and clean as Japan.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
